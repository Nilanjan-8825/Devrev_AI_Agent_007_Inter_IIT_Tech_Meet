# DevRev-InterIIT-TechMeet-12.0-Team99

At Inter IIT Tech Meet 12.0, the challenge required us to develop a language model that could utilize a set of tools to answer user queries effectively. This involved determining the appropriate subset of tools to use for each query, specifying the arguments with which these tools should be called, and devising a method to integrate the tools' outputs to formulate a coherent and accurate response.
To tackle this problem, we leveraged several large language models: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Llama 2, and Falcon. We conducted a comparative analysis of these models to evaluate their performance in selecting the right tools, using them efficiently, and producing high-quality answers. We identified the strengths and weaknesses of each model in this context, ultimately gaining insights into their capabilities and potential applications in real-world scenarios.
